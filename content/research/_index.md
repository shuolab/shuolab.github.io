    Our lab’s research focuses on elucidating how memory is encoded, retained, and retrieved within
    neural networks and molecules in the brain. We employ and develop cutting-edge tools to record
    and manipulate neuronal and molecular activities to unravel neural mechanisms underlying
    memory processes. Our integrative approach combines electrophysiology, imaging, behavior,
    genetic manipulations, omics, and computational modeling.
    <br>
    <br>
    The major tools used in the lab include <em>in vivo</em> electrophysiology, two-photon calcium imaging,
    one-photon endoscopic imaging, fiber photometry, opto-/chemo-genetic manipulations, and <em>ex
    vivo</em> electrophysiology. We also actively develop our own tools to address specific scientific
    questions through bioengineering, chemical synthesis, (nano)materials engineering, and
    electrical engineering.

    Much of our work focuses on the hippocampus, a brain region giving rise to neural sequences
    underlying episodic memory. These sequences, occurring during both behavior (e.g. theta
    sequences) and sleep (e.g. replay sequences), lay the foundation for memory encoding and
    consolidation. We believe what drives these sequences is a brain-wide oscillation network, and
    our lab is elucidating the key nodes in this network and how information is transmitted and
    computed among them.

    <div class="pt-2"></div>
    One recent focus of the lab is an understudied subcortical structure in the brain’s oscillation
    network, the supramammillary nucleus (SuM). This small hypothalamic nucleus is unique in its
    broad, extensive connections to the hippocampus and cortex. We are investigating how these
    long-range, bottom-up pathways modulate network dynamics to process memory.

    Manipulating memory and cognition requires technologies to spatiotemporally modulate nervous
    systems in deep tissue, sometimes in a precision closed-loop manner. For decades, physicians
    have utilized implanted electrodes connected through wires to a pacemaker-like device under the
    skin of the chest to electrically stimulate neurons deep in the brain. This approach, known as
    deep brain stimulation, has proven to be effective, but is costly, highly invasive, and lacks cell
    specificity.

    Our lab is developing noninvasive, high-precision neuromodulation technologies to manipulate
    diverse deep structures in the nervous system that are conventionally hard and intrusive to reach.
    We adopt a cross-disciplinary approach by designing and synthesizing molecularly engineered,
    noninvasively delivered nano- or micro-interfaces capable of converting tissue-penetrable stimuli
    into signals recognized/sensible by genetically defined cells. We believe such efforts will
    contribute to the field’s collective efforts in unlocking diverse routes towards next-generation,

    Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly. There is
    currently no cure for AD, and clinical trials only provide modest benefits.
    <br>
    <div class="pt-2"></div>
    While characterized by pathological molecules like amyloid-β, tau and APOE4, AD is a mental
    and cognitive disorder. How the molecular pathologies of AD lead to cognitive decline remains
    elusive. Bridging this gap requires understanding neural circuit mechanisms. By leveraging our
    expertise in systems neuroscience, our lab is identifying circuit pathophysiology of AD by using
    animal models of different pathologies.
    <br>
    <div class="pt-2"></div>
    Once elucidated, circuit mechanisms of AD could be employed to develop next-generation,
    circuit-targeted therapies to restore memory and cognition. Individualized, circuit-oriented
    diagnosis and treatment may become possible with time.
