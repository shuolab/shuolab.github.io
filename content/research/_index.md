    Our lab’s research focuses on elucidating how memory is 
    encoded, retained, and retrieved within neural networks and molecules in the brain. 
    We employ and develop cutting-edge tools to record and manipulate neuronal and molecular activities to unravel these mysteries.
    Our approach is integrative, expanding from electrophysiology, imaging, behavior, genetic manipulations, omics, to computational modeling.

    Much of our work focuses on the hippocampus, a brain region giving rise to neural sequences underlying 
    episodic memory. These sequences, occurring during either behavior (e.g. theta sequences) or sleep (e.g. replay 
    sequences), lay the foundation of memory encoding and consolidation. We believe what drives these sequences 
    is a brain-wide oscillation network, and our lab is elucidating the key nodes in this network and how information 
    is transmitted and computed among them.
    <br>
    One recent focus of the lab is an understudied subcortical structure in the brain’s oscillation network, the 
    supramammillary nucleus (SuM). Unique about this small hypothalamic nucleus is its broad, extensive 
    connections to the hippocampus and cortex. We are investigating how these long-range bottom-up pathways 
    modulate network dynamics to process memory.

            Complex cognitive activities, such as thinking and planning, rely on established knowledge about the external world. 
            We believe that by elaborately designed behavioral tasks, combined with large-scale in vivo recordings of neural activity, 
            we may probe the underlying neural computation mechanisms. 
            Our lab employs this approach to investigate how the brain synthesizes novel ideas and solutions from stored information – 
            i.e. memory retrieval and utilization. By drawing inspiration from psychology, engineering, and computer sciences, 
            we aim to dissect neural computational mechanisms underlying memory-guided complex behaviors.

<div class="text-m-research py-2">
    Manipulating memory and cognition requires technologies to spatiotemporally modulate nervous systems in 
    deep tissue, sometimes in a precision closed-loop manner. For decades, physicians have utilized implanted 
    electrodes connected through wires to a pacemaker-like device under the skin of the chest to electrically 
    stimulate neurons deep in the brain. This approach, known as deep brain stimulation, has proved to be 
    effective, but is costly, highly invasive, and lacks cell specificity.
    <br>
    Our lab is developing noninvasive, high-precision neuromodulation technologies to manipulate diverse deep 
    structures in the nervous system that are conventionally hard and intrusive to reach. We adopt a cross
    disciplinary approach by designing and synthesizing molecularly engineered, noninvasively delivered nano- or 
    micro-interfaces capable of converting tissue-penetrable stimuli into signals sensible by genetically defined 
    cells. We believe such efforts will contribute to the field’s collective efforts in unlocking diverse routes towards 
    next-generation, noninvasive neuromodulation therapies.

<div class="text-m-research py-2">
    Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly. There is currently no cure for 
    AD, and clinical trials only provide modest benefits. While characterized by pathological molecules like 
    amyloid-β, tau and APOE4, AD is a mental and cognitive disorder. How the molecular pathologies of AD lead to 
    cognitive decline remains elusive. Bridging this gap requires understanding neural circuit mechanisms. By 
    leveraging our expertise in systems neuroscience, our lab is identifying circuit pathophysiology of AD by using 
    animal models of different pathologies. Once elucidated, circuit mechanisms of AD could be employed to 
    develop next-generation, circuit-targeted therapies to restore memory and cognition. Individualized, circuit
    oriented diagnosis and treatment may become possible with time
